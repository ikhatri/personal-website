In the fall of 2019 I was an undergraduate course assistant for [CS 326 at UMass Amherst](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/jzosotk9w3v11t/h06xg9xsqsv68m/k04bwmeaphju/1_Course_Introduction.pdf) taught by [Professor Tim Richards](https://sites.google.com/cs.umass.edu/tim-richards/). CS 326 is a course in which students work in groups to complete a full web development project from start to finish. The teaching materials cover HTML, CSS and JavaScript and the students have to create a web based application to do anything of their choosing as the final project. As an undergraduate course assistant I was effectively the scrum master for 3 groups of students. Below is a list of projects which I supervised.
