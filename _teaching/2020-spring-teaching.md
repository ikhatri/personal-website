In the spring of 2020 I was a graduate teaching assistant for [CS 326 at UMass Amherst](http://web-programming.org) taught by [Professor Emory Berger](https://emeryberger.com/). CS 326 is a course in which students work in groups to complete a full web development project from start to finish. The teaching materials cover HTML, CSS and JavaScript and the students have to create a web based application to do anything of their choosing as the final project.
