# Personal Website
This repo contains my personal website [https://ishan.khatri.io](https://ishan.khatri.io)

I'm not a CSS god so I use templates. Mostly from [html5up.net](https://html5up.net) (highly recommended if you need a slick website template).

The current iteration is based on Stuart Geigers' excellent [academic pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) Jekyll theme.
