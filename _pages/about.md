Hi! My name is Ishan and I'm a software engineer at [Argo AI](https://www.argo.ai) where I work on creating robust perception algorithms for self-driving cars. My main interests lie in robotics and artificial intellegence research at the intersection of perception and planning. I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2019. While a student, I worked under [Joydeep Biswas](https://www.joydeepb.com/) in the [Autonomous Mobile Robotics Lab](https://amrl.cs.umass.edu/) and then under [Shlomo Zilberstein](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/shlomo/) in the Resource Bounded Reasoning Lab.
