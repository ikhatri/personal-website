Work experience
======
Currently I'm a software engineer working at [Argo AI](https://argo.ai) on the special projects team to solve on challenging robotics problems. In the past I've worked at the following places:

* [Argo AI](https://argo.ai) - as an intern on the Onboard Libraries team where I worked to write fast C++ libraries for use onboard the Argo self-driving vehicle
* [Philips Respironics](https://www.respironics.com/) - as an intern on the Advanced Innovations team, where I was developing new ways for people to interact with Philips products using Natural Language Processing
* [University of Pittsburgh's sciVelo](https://scivelo.pitt.edu) - as an intern helping faculty at Pitt create business plans for the commercialization of their research

Coding Projects
======
* [Dashboard](https://github.com/fuseumass/dashboard) - a Ruby on Rails web app used for registration, hardware inventory, hardware checkouts, mentorship, check in, and everything else you would need at a hackathon
* [Hackerforce](https://github.com/fuseumass/hackerforce) - a Django based CRM tool created to help hackathon organizers manage their sponsorship leads and keep track of contacts, emails and more
* [Configuration Reader](https://github.com/ut-amrl/ConfigurationReader) - a strongly typed, header only Lua-based config file reader for C++ 11 that supports the runtime reloading of parameter values on config file save

Other Projects
======
As an undergraduate I was a key organizer of [HackUMass](https://hackumass.com) and the director for [HackUMass VI](https://about.hackumass.com/events.html). I led the expansion of HackUmass into one of the largest collegiate hackathons in the country. Additionally I was an advisor for [HackHer413](https://hackher413.com) the first female and non-binary hackathon in Western Massachusetts as well as a founding member of [Fuse](https://github.com/fuseumass), UMass Amherst's joint hackathon planning organization.

Shortly after graduating high school, I had an opportunity to be a teaching assistant for [Leap@CMU](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~leap/), a now discontinued summer camp for high school students run by [Dr. Steven Rudich](https://cs.cmu.edu/~rudich/) at Carnegie Mellon University.
